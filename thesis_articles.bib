  abstract = {An analysis of the factors controlling rates of nitrogen cycling in northern temperate forest ecosystems is presented based on a quantitative analysis of an extensive data set for forests in Wisconsin and Massachusetts as those data are synthesized in a computer model (VEGIE) of organic matter and nutrient dynamics. The model is of the @'lumped-parameter,@' nutrient-flux-density type, dealing with major components of forest ecosystems rather than stems or species. It deals explicitly with the interactions among light, water, and nutrient availability in determining transient and equilibrium rates of primary production and nutrient cycling. Data are presented for parameterizing the plant component of the system at either the species or community level. A major conclusion is that the ultimate control on equilibrium nitrogen-cycling rates resides not within the nitrogen cycle itself (for example in litter quality or net primary production [NPP] allocation patterns) but rather in ratios of resource-use efficiency by vegetation as compared with the ratios of resource availability. Litter quality and allocation patterns, along with rates of N deposition, do affect the rate at which a system approaches the equilibrium cycling rate. The model is used to explain observed variation in nitrogen-cycling rates among forest types, and to predict the timing and occurrence of @'nitrogen saturation@' (N availability in excess of biotic demand) as a function of nitrogen deposition rates and harvesting.},

We understand much of how mycorrhizae work, but integrating all possible mechanisms into a whole has proven elusive. Multiple evolutionary events and the long evolutionary history mean that different plants and fungi bring independent characteristics to the symbiosis. This variety results in extensive physiological variation. How do we integrate functional responses with diversity to understand the role of mycorrhizae in ecosystems? We review ecophysiological mechanisms of mycorrhizae and organize these into functional groups. Species-area relationships are not curvilinear, but resemble the "broken stick" model. We coupled functional groups with a metacommunity analysis to show how complex behavior can be generated using a simple matrix model of resource exchange. This approach provides insights into how we might integrate diversity and function across landscapes.},

  abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

  abstract = {The postmortem microbiome has recently moved to the forefront of forensic research, and many studies have focused on the idea that predictable fluctuations in decomposer communities could be used as a “microbial clock” to determine time of death. Commonly, the oral microbiome has been evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the changes in community composition throughout decomposition. We sampled the hard palates of three human donors over time to identify the prominent members of the microbiome. This study combined 16S rRNA sequencing with whole metagenomic (MetaG) and metatranscriptomic (MetaT) sequencing and culturing methodologies in an attempt to broaden current knowledge about how these postmortem microbiota change and might function throughout decomposition. In all four methods, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, but their distributions were insufficient in separating samples based on decomposition stage or time or by donor. Better resolution was observed at the level of genus, with fresher samples from decomposition clustering away from others via principal components analysis (PCA) of the sequencing data. Key genera in driving these trends included Rothia; Lysinibacillus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, and other Firmicutes; and yeasts including Candida and Yarrowia. The majority of cultures (89\%) matched to sequences obtained from at least one of the sequencing methods, while 11 cultures were found in the same samples using all three methods. These included Acinetobacter gerneri, Comamonas terrigena, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas koreensis, Pseudomonas moraviensis, Raoutella terrigena, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Kurthia zopfii, and Lactobacillus paracasei. MetaG and MetaT data also revealed many novel insects as likely visitors to the donors in this study, opening the door to investigating them as potential vectors of microorganisms during decomposition. The presence of cultures at specific time points in decomposition, including samples for which we have MetaT data, will yield future studies tying specific taxa to metabolic pathways involved in decomposition. Overall, we have shown that our 16S rRNA sequencing results from the human hard palate are consistent with other studies and have expanded on the range of taxa shown to be associated with human decomposition, including eukaryotes, based on additional sequencing technologies.},

Nitrogen fertilization is hypothesized to favor arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species at the expense of ectomycorrhizal species due to differences in fungal nitrogen acquisition strategies, and this may alter soil carbon balance, as differences in forest mycorrhizal associations are linked to differences in soil carbon pools. Combining nitrogen deposition data with continental‐scale US forest data, we show that nitrogen pollution is spatially associated with a decline in ectomycorrhizal vs. arbuscular mycorrhizal trees. Furthermore, nitrogen deposition has contrasting effects on arbuscular vs. ectomycorrhizal demographic processes, favoring arbuscular mycorrhizal trees at the expense of ectomycorrhizal trees, and is spatially correlated with reduced soil carbon stocks. This implies future changes in nitrogen deposition may alter the capacity of forests to sequester carbon and offset climate change via interactions with the forest microbiome.},

High-resolution description of microbial communities, detection of taxa with minor abundances, screening of gene expression or the detailed characterization of metabolomes are nowadays technically feasible. Despite all of this, our understanding of soil is limited in many ways. The imperfect tools to describe microbial communities and limited possibilities to assign traits to community members make it difficult to link microbes to functions. Also the analysis of processes exemplified by enzyme activity measurements is still imperfect. In the future, it is important to look at soil at a finer detail to obtain a better picture on the properties of individual microbes, their in situ interactions, metabolic rates and activity at a scale relevant to individual microbes. Scaling up is needed as well to get answers at ecosystem or biome levels and to enable global modelling. The recent development of novel tools including metabolomics, identification of genomes in metagenomics sequencing datasets or collection of trait data have the potential to bring soil ecology further. It will, however, always remain a highly demanding scientific discipline.},

In this review, recent studies on the influence of the two factors, plant species and soil type, on rhizosphere-associated microbial communities are discussed. Root exudates and the response of microorganisms to the latter as well as to root morphology were shown to shape rhizosphere microbial communities. All studies revealed that soil is the main reservoir for rhizosphere microorganisms. Many secrets of microbial life in the rhizosphere were recently uncovered due to the enormous progress in molecular and microscopic tools. Physiological and molecular data on the factors that drive selection processes in the rhizosphere are presented here. Furthermore, implications for agriculture, nature conservation and biotechnology will also be discussed.},

We examined more than 1,000 soils and found this spartobacterial phylotype to be ubiquitous and consistently one of the most abundant soil bacterial phylotypes, particularly in grasslands, where it was typically the most abundant. We reconstructed a nearly complete genome of this phylotype from a soil metagenome for which we propose the provisional name ‘Candidatus Udaeobacter copiosus’. The Ca. U. copiosus genome is unusually small for a cosmopolitan soil bacterium, estimated by one measure to be only 2.81\hspace{0.25em}Mbp, compared to the predicted effective mean genome size of 4.74\hspace{0.25em}Mbp for soil bacteria. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that Ca. U. copiosus is an aerobic heterotroph with numerous putative amino acid and vitamin auxotrophies. The large population size, relatively small genome and multiple putative auxotrophies characteristic of Ca. U. copiosus suggest that it may be undergoing streamlining selection to minimize cellular architecture, a phenomenon previously thought to be restricted to aquatic bacteria. Although many soil bacteria need relatively large, complex genomes to be successful in soil, Ca. U. copiosus appears to use an alternative strategy, sacrificing metabolic versatility for efficiency to become dominant in the soil environment.},

In four provinces in south China, 155 plantations were sampled for sporocarps of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, spores of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and mycorrhizas over 2~years. This study revealed a low above-ground diversity of ECM fungi consisting of 15 taxa fruiting beneath Eucalyptus plantations. The most common ECM genera were Scleroderma and Pisolithus, but they were infrequent. A total of 21~AM fungi, mostly Glomus species, were recognized from spores collected from eucalypt plantations. Four Glomus species were frequently present in soils, but spore density and relative abundance of AM fungi were generally low. Eucalypt roots from all plantation sites were poorly colonized by either ECM fungi or AM fungi. A bioassay with E. urophylla as a bait host, using soils collected from 11 eucalypt plantations, confirmed low levels of inoculum of both ECM and AM fungi in field soil. This is the first integrated study on the mycorrhizal status of eucalypt plantations in China. Findings from this research can be used to encourage adoption of mycorrhizal technology by eucalypt nurseries in the region. The potential of using spores of compatible ECM fungi or collections for forest nurseries is discussed.},

  abstract = {Mycorrhizal associations are ubiquitous and form a substantial component of the microbial biomass in forest ecosystems and fluxes of C to these belowground organisms account for a substantial portion of carbon assimilated by forest vegetation. Climate change has been predicted to alter belowground plant-allocated C which may cause compositional shifts in soil microbial communities, and it has been hypothesized that this community change will influence C mitigation in forest ecosystems. Some 10,000 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi are currently recognized, some of which are host specific and will only associate with a single tree species, for example, Suillus grevillei with larch. Mycorrhizae are a strong sink for plant C, differences in mycorrhizal anatomy, particularly the presence and extent of emanating hyphae, can affect the amount of plant C allocated to these assemblages. Mycorrhizal morphology affects not only spatial distribution of C in forests, but also differences in the longevity of these diverse structures may have important consequences for C sequestration in soil. Mycorrhizal growth form has been used to group fungi into distinctive functional groups that vary qualitatively and spatially in their foraging and nutrient acquiring potential. Through new genomic techniques we are beginning to understand the mechanisms involved in the specificity and selection of ectomycorrhizal associations though much less is known about arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. In this review we examine evidence for tree species- mycorrhizal specificity, and the mechanisms involved (e.g., signal compounds). We also explore what is known about the effects of these associations and interactions with other soil organisms on the quality and quantity of C flow into the mycorrhizosphere (the area under the influence of mycorrhizal root tips), including spatial and seasonal variations. The enormity of the mycorrhizosphere biome in forests and its potential to sequester substantial C belowground highlights the vital importance of increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of the different mycorrhizal functional groups in diverse forests.},

Using a Delphi survey method with three iterative surveys, we found that oak decline and climate change were identified as critical current and future threats, respectively, in this region. Focusing on climate change, experts were asked a series of questions to assess its potential future temporal and spatial impact on oaks. With respect to climate change, the majority of experts surveyed believe climate change will manifest gradually, although they were generally uncertain about the geographical distribution of climate change in the future, i.e., the areas where oaks are likely to be impacted by climate change in the future. New/emerging pests and pathogens were seen as the most critical future threat by the third survey round. Results from this study can be used to better inform management practices and research priorities for ensuring resilient oak resources for the future.},

  abstract = {The controls on aboveground community composition and diversity have been extensively studied, but our understanding of the drivers of belowground microbial communities is relatively lacking, despite their importance for ecosystem functioning. In this study, we fitted statistical models to explain landscape-scale variation in soil microbial community composition using data from 180 sites covering a broad range of grassland types, soil and climatic conditions in England. We found that variation in soil microbial communities was explained by abiotic factors like climate, pH and soil properties. Biotic factors, namely community-weighted means (CWM) of plant functional traits, also explained variation in soil microbial communities. In particular, more bacterial-dominated microbial communities were associated with exploitative plant traits versus fungal-dominated communities with resource-conservative traits, showing that plant functional traits and soil microbial communities are closely related at the landscape scale.},

  abstract = {Traditionally microbial communities were assessed through culturing, which limits the populations detected. Molecular techniques are becoming more popular when assessing microbial communities. To illustrate gene variability between sites terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used in this study. Bacterial 16S rDNA and archaeal and bacterial amoA diversity was examined from Albright Grove, Cataloochee, and Purchase Knob in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) using T-RFLP. Bacterial 16S rDNA T-RFLP electoferrogram peak data revealed that Cataloochee and Purchase Knob had a greater diversity compared to Albright Grove, with 60 different peaks and 17 unique peaks at each site, and 60 different peaks and 18 unique peaks, respectively, while Albright Grove had a total of 45 different peaks and 9 unique peaks. A comparison showed 28.6\% of major peaks were shared between all three. Archaeal amoA T-RFLP electoferrogram peak data revealed that Cataloochee and Purchase Knob had a greater diversity compared to Albright Grove, with 105 different peaks and 30 unique peaks, and 103 different peaks and 22 unique peaks at each site, respectively, while Albright Grove had a total of 82 different peaks and 13 unique peaks at the site. No major peaks were shared between all three sites viii PCR products for bacterial amoA were only produced from Purchase Knob and generated a total of 10 peaks. Overall diversity appeared to be higher in the disturbed sites of Cataloochee and Purchase Knob compared to the undisturbed site of Albright Grove. Since, the rhizosphere is a complex system a number of other variables could impact the structure of the microbial community, and must be taken into consideration when examining diversity. This study has provided insight into the spatial variability of the microbial community in the Eastern Hemlock rhizosphere, and further examination may help mediate the devastating loss of the hemlock due to an exotic adelgid species.},

  abstract = {Understanding patterns of biodiversity in microbial communities is severely constrained by the difficulty of adequately sampling these complex systems. We illustrate the problem with empirical data from small surveys (200-member 16S rRNA gene clone libraries) of four bacterial soil communities from two locations in Arizona. Among the four surveys, nearly 500 species-level groups (Dunbar et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 65:662-1669, 1999) and 21 bacterial divisions were documented, including four new candidate divisions provisionally designated SC1, SC2, SC3, and SC4. We devised a simple approach to constructing theoretical null models of bacterial species abundance. These null models provide, for the first time, detailed descriptions of soil bacterial community structure that can be used to guide experimental design. Models based on a lognormal distribution were consistent with the observed sizes of the four communities and the richness of the clone surveys. Predictions from the models showed that the species richness of small surveys from complex communities is reproducible, whereas the species composition is not. By using the models, we can now estimate the required survey scale to document specified fractions of community diversity. For example, documentation of half the species in each model community would require surveys of 16,284 to 44,000 individuals. However, quantitative comparisons of half the species in two communities would require surveys at least 10-fold larger for each community.},

It is found that for some values of k, and for m not too large, intervals obtained in this way are shorter than those using the F distribution or the Studentized range. When this is so, the experimenter may be willing to select the linear combinations in advance which he wishes to estimate in order to have m shorter intervals instead of an infinite number of longer intervals.},

Circulation of anthropogenic Nr in Earth’s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere has a wide variety of consequences, which are magnified with time as Nr moves along its biogeochemical pathway. The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

  abstract = {A rapid, community-level approach for assessing patterns of sole carbon source utilization by mixed microbial samples has been used increasingly to study microbial community dynamics. The method involves direct inoculation of environmental samples into Biolog microtiter plates, and uses color formation from reduction of a tetrazolium dye to assess utilization of 95 separate sole carbon sources during a 2–7 day incubation period. This approach, called community-level physiological profiling, has been effective at distinguishing spatial and temporal changes in microbial communities. Effective analysis of the multivariate profiles of carbon source utilization requires separation of effects caused by differences in inoculum density (i.e. overall rate of color development) from effects caused by differences in the types or activities of organisms present (i.e. relative rates, or pattern, of carbon source utilization). Further experimental studies are required to better define what fraction of the original inoculum responds in the assay, and if the profiles provide structural and/or functional information.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are vital in mediating the earth’s biogeochemical cycles; yet, despite our rapidly increasing ability to explore complex environmental microbial communities, the relationship between microbial community structure and ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. Here, we address a fundamental and unanswered question in microbial ecology: ‘When do we need to understand microbial community structure to accurately predict function?’ We present a statistical analysis investigating the value of environmental data and microbial community structure independently and in combination for explaining rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within 82 global datasets. Environmental variables were the strongest predictors of process rates but left 44\% of variation unexplained on average, suggesting the potential for microbial data to increase model accuracy. Although only 29\% of our datasets were significantly improved by adding information on microbial community structure, we observed improvement in models of processes mediated by narrow phylogenetic guilds via functional gene data, and conversely, improvement in models of facultative microbial processes via community diversity metrics. Our results also suggest that microbial diversity can strengthen predictions of respiration rates beyond microbial biomass parameters, as 53\% of models were improved by incorporating both sets of predictors compared to 35\% by microbial biomass alone. Our analysis represents the first comprehensive analysis of research examining links between microbial community structure and ecosystem function. Taken together, our results indicate that a greater understanding of microbial communities informed by ecological principles may enhance our ability to predict ecosystem process rates relative to assessments based on environmental variables and microbial physiology.},

Microbial communities were characterised through community level physiological profiles (CLPP), and profiling of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Microbial communities from cedar forest floors had higher potential C utilisation than the other species. The F layer of the forest floor under cedar contained significantly higher bacterial biomass (PLFA) than the F layer under the other three tree species. There were differences in microbial communities among the three sites: Upper Klanawa had the highest bacterial biomass and potential C utilisation; this site also had the highest N availability in the forest floors. Forest floor H layers under hemlock and Douglas-fir contained greater biomass of Gram positive, Gram negative bacteria and actinomycetes than F layers based on PLFA, and H layers under spruce contained greater biomass of Gram negative bacteria than F layers. There were no significant differences in bacterial biomass between forest floor layers under cedar. Fungal biomass displayed opposite trends to bacteria and actinomycetes, being lowest in cedar forest floors, and highest in the F layer and at the site with lowest N availability. There were also differences in community composition among species and sites, with cedar forest floors having a much lower fungal:bacterial ratio than spruce, hemlock and Douglas-fir. The least fertile Sarita Lake site had a much greater fungal:bacterial ratio than the more fertile San Juan and Upper Klanawa sites. Forest floor layer had the greatest effect on microbial community structure and potential function, followed by site, and tree species. The similarity in trends among measures of N availability and microbial communities is further evidence that these techniques provide information on microbial communities that is relevant to N cycling processes in the forest floor.},

Forest managers need tools to predict acorn production capability tailored to individual landscapes and forest management scenarios, adjusting for oak mortality and stand development over time. We implemented published predictive models of average annual acorn production by five oak species common to the eastern United States in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) and used forest inventory data to estimate long-term acorn production on the Bent Creek Experimental Forest watershed, with and without oak decline. Under a no-management scenario, simulations forecasted a 58\% increase in average annual acorn production by 2062 without oak decline but a 17\% decrease with oak decline. Forecasts were influenced by the initial abundance and basal area of different oak species on the landscape and stand dynamics over time. Simulations indicated that heavy oak mortality with regeneration failure could substantially affect acorn production over the long term by reducing the proportion of mature canopy oaks and relative abundance of oak species. FVS ACORN provides a powerful tool for long-term acorn production planning that can be tailored to individual landscapes and forest management scenarios to predict average annual number and mass of acorns.},

Multiplication is by budding at the hyphal tips, with the long axis of the bud arranged perpendicular to the hyphal axis (Figures 1 and 2). Mature buds either separate from the hyphae as uniflagellated swarmers or remain attached. Extracellular polymers can be stained with ruthenium red and sometimes are visible in India ink mounts as thick capsules around mother cells. Oxidized iron or manganese compounds are deposited on mother cells and later on hyphae. Resting stages are not known. Gram negative, older cells variable. Swarmer cells are motile by a single subpolar or polar flagellum (Figure 3). Other stages of the cell cycle (Figure 4) are nonmotile. Colonies are yellowish or reddish brown to dark brown, due to accumulated iron or manganese oxides. Aerobic. Catalase positive (test is in absence of MnO2 and at neutral pH). Chemoorganotrophic. Acetate is utilized as a carbon source; most strains also grow on caproate or pyruvate. Protein digests, such as yeast extract, peptone, Casamino acids, and soytone, serve as carbon and/or nitrogen sources. Organic nitrogen sources utilized by most strains are glutamate, aspartate, glycine, serine, threonine, and valine. Inorganic nitrogen compounds allow only poor growth of some isolates; nitrate is reduced by most strains. Slow and poor growth occurs on agar media with 0.1–1\% fulvic acid iron sesquioxide complexes as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Vitamin mixtures stimulate growth; lack of vitamins results in pleomorphic cells, which produce large granules of poly-β-hydroxybutyric acid. Growth is inhibited by polymyxin B and neomycin. The mol\% G + C of the DNA is: 63–66.8. Type species: Pedomicrobium ferrugineum Aristovskaya 1961, 957, emend. Gebers and Beese 1988, 308.},

  abstract = {The class Alphaproteobacteria is comprised of a diverse assemblage of Gram-negative bacteria that includes organisms of varying morphologies, physiologies and habitat preferences many of which are of clinical and ecological importance. Alphaproteobacteria classification has proved to be difficult, not least when taxonomic decisions rested heavily on a limited number of phenotypic features and interpretation of poorly resolved 16S rRNA gene trees. Despite progress in recent years regarding the classification of bacteria assigned to the class, there remains a need to further clarify taxonomic relationships. Here, draft genome sequences of a collection of genomes of more than 1000 Alphaproteobacteria and outgroup type strains were used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using the principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders, families and genera, including taxa recognized as problematic long ago but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are made for the recognition of new orders, families and genera, as well as the transfer of a variety of species to other genera and of a variety of genera to other families. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size, both of which are confirmed as valuable taxonomic markers. Similarly, analysis of the gene content was shown to provide valuable taxonomic insights in the class. Significant incongruities between 16S rRNA gene and whole genome trees were not found in the class. The incongruities that became obvious when comparing the results of the present study with existing classifications appeared to be caused mainly by insufficiently resolved 16S rRNA gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling. Another probable cause of misclassifications in the past is the partially low overall fit of phenotypic characters to the sequence-based tree. Even though a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation was detected in all characters investigated, the overall fit to the tree varied considerably.},

  abstract = {How nitrogen (N) cycling is regulated and how environmental change affects it are major study questions in forest ecology, because N availability often limits the primary production of plants in many forest ecosystems. These are being extensively highlighted because of growing concerns regarding chronic and elevated N deposition in forest ecosystems on a global scale. Until now, N cycling has been mainly documented in association with various environmental factors other than microbial communities. However, with the recent rapid development in culture-independent molecular-based techniques, microbial ecologists have discovered that alterations in N cycling are highly associated with alternations in microbial communities through changes in either resource supplies or processing rates. In this review, we describe nitrification as a key N cycling process and present general approaches to associate the nitrification process with the nitrifying community in forest soils. Furthermore, we briefly summarize currently available information about the relationship between the process and nitrifying community dynamics in soil. We suppose that linking N cycling processes with microbial community dynamics provides a deeper insight into the mechanisms regulating N cycling in forest ecosystems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Candidatus phylum Eremiobacterota (formerly WPS-2) is an as-yet-uncultured bacterial clade that takes its name from Ca. Eremiobacter, an Antarctic soil aerobe proposed to be capable of a novel form of chemolithoautotrophy termed atmospheric chemosynthesis, that uses the energy derived from atmospheric H2-oxidation to fix CO2 through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle via type 1E RuBisCO. To elucidate the phylogenetic affiliation and metabolic capacities of Ca. Eremiobacterota, we analysed 63 public metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and nine new MAGs generated from Antarctic soil metagenomes. These MAGs represent both recognized classes within Ca. Eremiobacterota, namely Ca. Eremiobacteria and UBP9. Ca. Eremiobacteria are inferred to be facultatively acidophilic with a preference for peptides and amino acids as nutrient sources. Epifluorescence microscopy revealed Ca. Eremiobacteria cells from Antarctica desert soil to be coccoid in shape. Two orders are recognized within class Ca. Eremiobacteria: Ca. Eremiobacterales and Ca. Baltobacterales. The latter are metabolically versatile, with individual members having genes required for trace gas driven autotrophy, anoxygenic photosynthesis, CO oxidation, and anaerobic respiration. UBP9, here renamed Ca. Xenobia class. nov., are~inferred to be obligate heterotrophs with acidophilic adaptations, but individual members having highly divergent metabolic capacities compared to Ca. Eremiobacteria, especially with regard to respiration and central carbon metabolism. We conclude Ca. Eremiobacterota to be an ecologically versatile phylum with the potential to thrive under an array of “extreme” environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have indicated that an enriched atmosphere of carbon dioxide (CO2) could exacerbate the intensity of plant invasions within natural ecosystems, but little is known of how rising CO2 impacts the belowground characteristics of these invaded systems. In this study, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 and nitrogen (N) inputs on plant and soil microbial community characteristics of plant communities invaded by reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinacea L. We grew the invasive grass under two levels of invasion: the invader was either dominant (high invasion) at 490\% plant cover or sub-dominant (low invasion) at o50\% plant cover. Experimental wetland communities were grown for four months in greenhouses that received either 600 or 365 ml lÀ1 (ambient) CO2. Within each of three replicate rooms per CO2 treatment, the plant communities were grown under high (30 mg lÀ1) or low (5 mg lÀ1) N. In contrast to what is often predicted under N limitation, we found that elevated CO2 increased native graminoid biomass at low N, but not at high N. The aboveground biomass of reed canary grass did not respond to elevated CO2, despite it being a fast-growing C3 species. Although elevated CO2 had no impact on the plant biomass of heavily invaded communities, the relative abundance of several soil microbial indicators increased. In contrast, the moderately invaded plant communities displayed increased total root biomass under elevated CO2, while little impact occurred on the relative abundance of soil microbial indicators. Principal components analysis indicated that overall soil microbial community structure was distinct by CO2 level for the varying N and invasion treatments. This study demonstrates that even when elevated CO2 does not have visible effects on aboveground plant biomass, it can have large impacts belowground.},

Growth on carbohydrate media is usually accompanied by copious amounts of extracellular polysaccharide. Pronounced turbidity develops after 2 or 3 days in aerated or agitated broth. Chemoorganotrophic, utilizing a wide range of carbohydrates and salts of organic acids as sole carbon sources, without gas formation. Cellulose and starch are not utilized. Produce an acidic reaction in mineral-salts medium containing mannitol or other carbohydrates. Ammonium salts, nitrate, nitrite, and most amino acids can serve as nitrogen sources. Strains of some species will grow in a simple mineral salts medium with vitamin-free casein hydrolysate as the sole source of both carbon and nitrogen, but strains of many species require one or more growth factors such as biotin, pantothenate, or nicotinic acid. Peptone is poorly utilized. Casein, starch, chitin, and agar are not hydrolyzed. All known Rhizobium species include strains which induce hypertrophisms in plants as root nodules with or without symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Some cells of symbiotic bacterial species enter root hair cells of leguminous plants (Family Leguminosae) via invagination or by wounds (“crack entry”) and elicit the production of root nodules wherein the bacteria engage as intracellular symbionts, usually fixing nitrogen. Many well-defined nodulation (nod) and nitrogen fixation (nif) genes are clustered on large plasmids or megaplasmids (pSyms). Plasmid transfer between species results in the expression and stable inheritance of the particular plant-interactive properties of the plasmid-donor species. Plant host specificity is usually for a few legume genera but may, in some strains, include a wide variety of legume genera and is to some extent determined by the chemical structure of the lipochito-oligosaccharide Nod factors produced. These chitin-like molecules induce nodule organogenesis in the absence of bacteria. In root nodules the bacteria occur as endophytes that exhibit pleomorphic forms, termed “bacteroids”, which reduce or fix gaseous atmospheric nitrogen into a combined form utilizable by the host plant.

  abstract = {The understanding of nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems has undergone a major shift in the past decade as molecular methods are being used to link microorganisms to key processes in soil. The analysis of the abundance and community structure of functional genes involved in the biogeochemical cycling of N in forest soils offers an approach to directly link microbial groups to soil characteristics and ecosystem processes. The majority of N entering ecosystems is biologically-derived from fixation of atmospheric N2. Molecular studies of N-fixation use the nitrogenase reductase (nifH) marker gene, and can be used to link N-fixation to other N- and C-cycling processes. Inorganic N entering soil via N-fixation, fertilization and deposition can have several fates, depending on the soil environment and the microbial community. The loss of N from forests stands subject to fertilization and atmospheric deposition is of increasing interest as the outputs of nitrate (NO3−) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are implicated in ground water pollution and climate change, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) oxidize ammonia (NH3) to NO3− as the first step of nitrification and are studied using the ammonium monooxygenase (amoA) marker. The abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizers is largely dependent on pH and availability of reactive N forms, and can change rapidly following N addition or after fire. These organisms can also release N2O during nitrifier denitrification or through linked nitrification–denitrification. In some forest soils, N2O emissions are correlated with genes in the denitrification pathway (napA, narG, nirK, nirS, nosZ) making these genes useful indicators of greenhouse gas (GHG) flux potential. A review of this topic is timely as there is currently much concern regarding the effect of N fertilization and deposition on North American and European forests due to the potential alteration of dissimilative N-cycling processes and the potential for increased N2O emissions in forest stands.},

Karst) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco) at four study sites. We measured soil chemical characteristics, net N mineralization, potential and relative nitrification, basal respiration, microbial and metabolic quotient and microbial biomass C and N under monoculture stands at all sites (one mixed stand). Tree species affected soil chemistry, microbial activities and biomass, but these effects varied between sites. Our results indicated that the effect of tree species on net N mineralization was likely to be mediated through their effect on soil microbial biomass, reflecting their influence on organic matter content and carbon availability. Differences in potential nitrification and relative nitrification might be related to the presence of ground vegetation through its influence on soil NH4 and labile C availability. Our findings highlight the need to study the effects of tree species on microbial activities at several sites to elucidate complex N cycle interactions between tree species, ground vegetation, soil characteristics and microbial processes.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial communities are so vastly diverse that complex interactions, which alter ecosystem functions, may occur among microbial species and functional groups. In this review, we explore the empirical evidence for situations when shifts in the community structure of microbes would elicit a change in ecosystem process rates, specifically decomposition, even when microbial biomass remains constant. In particular, we are interested in a subset of these scenarios in which knowledge of microbial community structure would improve model predictions for ecosystem functions. Results from microcosm and field studies indicate that microbial species diversity, functional group diversity, and community composition can all influence ecosystem process rates. The underlying mechanisms that may elicit changes in ecosystem functions from shifts in microbial community structure include evolutionary constraints on microbial trait adaptation, trait correlations, dispersal limitation, and species interactions. The extent of microbial diversity in soils is not known, so it is presently not possible to model all scenarios of microbial community structure shifts. However, by incorporating documented patterns in functional groups that are relevant for a particular ecosystem process and potential relationships between microbial phylogeny and function, the predictive power of process models will be significantly improved. The inclusion of this information into process models is critical for predicting and understanding how ecosystem functions may shift in response to global change.},

  abstract = {Intensive forest harvest techniques have the potential to alter soil carbon and nutrient stocks and biogeochemical processes. We investigated how differing levels of organic matter removal (OMR) during timber harvest influenced the long-term stability of nitrification and the microbes regulating this process. Nitrification is limited by the activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA); however, reports on the relative contribution of each of these groups to forest soil nitrification have varied and have not been investigated in response to OMR. The influence of soil depth on the structure and function of the ammonia-oxidizing community has also been underreported and was included in this study. We quantified soil physicochemical properties including concentrations of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrite (NO2−)~+~nitrate (NO3−), and also coupled next generation sequencing and qPCR of the amoA gene to a whole-soil assay that stimulates nitrification and allows for the discrimination of AOA-from AOB-activity using 1-octyne, which inhibits bacterial ammonia monooxygenase activity. Soils were collected (1~m depth) from replicated loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands subjected to three different intensities of OMR (i.e., unharvested control, bole-only harvest, and whole-tree harvest~+~forest floor removal). Increasing intensity of OMR and increasing soil depth lead to significant reductions in concentrations of in situ NH4+ and NO2−~+~NO3−. Sequencing and subsequent annotation of the ammonia oxidizing community revealed that AOA were dominated by Crenarchaeota and AOB were dominated by Nitrosospira spp. The abundance of both bacterial and archaeal amoA were influenced by OMR and soil depth; furthermore, archaeal amoA was more abundant than bacterial amoA across all soil depths and the ratio of AOA to AOB increased with depth. Community structure of AOA and AOB were influenced by soil depth; however, only AOB were altered by OMR. Soil incubations revealed nitrification was N-limited in these forest soils. Furthermore, AOA- and AOB-contributions to total nitrification were nearly equivalent in surface soils; however, AOA contribution increased to 75\% at 1~m. In general, the highest rates of nitrification occurred in the soils taken from unharvested control stands; however, OMR treatment differences were only significant when soils were amended with high levels of ammonia indicating that at ambient levels, intensive OMR may not lead to long-term alterations in nitrification potential.},

These two genera, Basidioascus and Geminibasidium gen. nov., are morphologically similar and phylogenetically related. The genus Basidioascus originally was described as an ascomycete, but the structures originally interpreted as single-spored asci appear to represent basidiospores. Morphologically both genera are characterized by the lack of a fruiting body, conspicuously granular and deciduous basidia with a unique basal lateral projection and apparently double-walled basidiospores. The basidia, rather than the basidiospores, are forcibly discharged in Basidioascus species but not in Geminibasidium species. In Geminibasidium species a putative basidium arises from a primary cell. These are novel forms of basidia ontogenesis previously unseen in basidiomycetes. The rDNA (SSU + 5.8S + LSU) Bayesian phylogenetic analysis suggests that these fungi are distantly related to Wallemia, another xerotolerant basidiomycete genus commonly found in indoor air dust, dried foods and natural hypersaline environments. Given the physiological similarity and phylogenetic relationships, Basidioascus and Geminibasidium are classified in a new order, Geminibasidiales, and are taxonomically assigned to the class Wallemiomycetes. Based on morphological observations and molecular phylogeny of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), two species of Basidioascus (B. undulatus, B. magus sp. nov.) and two species of Geminibasidium (G. donsium sp. nov., G. hirsutum sp. nov.) are described. A key to these species is provided using micromorphological and cultural characters.},

We investigated substrate and nutrient limitation by amending soils with either ammonium or a nutrient solution containing P and K, then assessing the growth of these organisms during in situ soil incubations. We found substantial growth of both AOA and AOB during all incubations including unamended control incubations. Our results demonstrate that substrate availability limits nitrification by AOB and that high levels of substrate addition inhibit the growth of AOA in these soils. We found no evidence for nutrient limitation of AOB, though nutrient addition indirectly stimulated nitrification by AOB through increased nitrogen mineralization. Our data did suggest nutrient limitation by AOA, though it is unclear whether AOA significantly contribute to ammonia oxidation in this system. Furthermore, we show that AOB are responsible for the majority of ammonia oxidation in high substrate, high nutrient conditions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the context dependence of ecosystem responses to global changes requires the development of new conceptual frameworks. Here we propose a framework for considering how tree species and their mycorrhizal associates differentially couple carbon (C) and nutrient cycles in temperate forests. Given that tree species predominantly associate with a single type of mycorrhizal fungi (arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi), and that the two types of fungi differ in their modes of nutrient acquisition, we hypothesize that the abundance of AM and ECM trees in a plot, stand, or region may provide an integrated index of biogeochemical transformations relevant to C cycling and nutrient retention. First, we describe how forest plots dominated by AM tree species have nutrient economies that differ in their C–nutrient couplings from those in plots dominated by ECM trees. Secondly, we demonstrate how the relative abundance of AM and ECM trees can be used to estimate nutrient dynamics across the landscape. Finally, we describe how our framework can be used to generate testable hypotheses about forest responses to global change factors, and how these dynamics can be used to develop better representations of plant–soil feedbacks and nutrient constraints on productivity in ecosystem and earth system models.},

  abstract = {Forest decline diseases are complex processes driven by biotic and abiotic factors. Although information about host–microbiome–environment interactions in agricultural systems is emerging rapidly, similar studies on tree health are still in their infancy. We used acute oak decline (AOD) as a model system to understand whether the rhizosphere physicochemical properties and microbiome are linked to tree health by studying these two factors in healthy and diseased trees located in three sites in different AOD stages—low, mid and severe. We found significant changes in the rhizosphere properties and microbiome composition across the different AOD sites and between the tree health conditions. Rhizosphere pH correlated with microbiome composition, with the microbial assemblages changing in more acidic soils. At the severe AOD site, the oak trees exhibited the lowest rhizosphere pH and distinct microbiome, regardless of their health condition, whereas, at the low and mid-stage AOD sites, only diseased trees showed lower pH and the microbial composition differed significantly from healthy trees. On these two sites, less extreme soil conditions and a high presence of host-beneficial microbiota were observed in the healthy oak trees. For the first time, this study gathers evidence of associations among tree health conditions, rhizosphere properties and microbiome as well as links aboveground tree decline symptoms to the belowground environment. This provides a baseline of rhizosphere community profiling of UK oak trees and paves the way for these associations to be investigated in other tree species suffering decline disease events.},

Here, we present a model-based approach to estimate independent contributions of microbial community shifts to ecosystem properties. The approach was tested empirically, using denitrification potential as our model process, in a spatial survey of arable land encompassing a range of edaphic conditions and two agricultural production systems. Soil nitrate was the most important single predictor of denitrification potential (the change in Akaike's information criterion, corrected for sample size, ΔAICc = 20.29); however, the inclusion of biotic variables (particularly the evenness and size of denitrifier communities [ΔAICc = 12.02], and the abundance of one denitrifier genotype [ΔAICc = 18.04]) had a substantial effect on model precision, comparable to the inclusion of abiotic variables (biotic R2 = 0.28, abiotic R2 = 0.50, biotic + abiotic R2 = 0.76). This approach provides a valuable tool for explicitly linking microbial communities to ecosystem functioning. By making this link, we have demonstrated that including aspects of microbial community structure and diversity in biogeochemical models can improve predictions of nutrient cycling in ecosystems and enhance our understanding of ecosystem functionality.},

  abstract = {Microbial communities in litter and soil are the functional link through which the tree species occupying a site may alter rates of soil processes fundamental to nutrient cycling and carbon flux. Through differences in the nature of their litter, their mycorrhizal fungal associates and the exudates they release into the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere, different tree species may give rise to distinct microbial communities in litter and soil. We examine the evidence that tree species influence the composition of the microbial communities in decomposing litter, forest floors, soil and the rhizo/mycorrhizosphere. The microbial communities considered in this review include bacteria, archaea, fungi and both free-living and symbiotic organisms. There is evidence that distinct microbial communities develop on decomposing leaf litters of different tree species, however, given the well-documented succession of microbes on decomposing litter, comparisons amongst tree species of microbial communities in litters and forest floors at the same stage of decay are needed to definitively deduce the influence of tree species. Distinct microbial communities have been reported in forest floors under different tree species; differences are most pronounced in the F layer. Distinctions in microbial communities in mineral soil under different tree species have been determined in several common garden experiments. The main factors associated with differences in microbial communities in litter, forest floors and soil are the pH and base cation content of the litter and whether the trees are broadleaf or coniferous. Identified differences in microbial communities in the rhizospheres of different tree species are more likely to be differences in the mycorrhizospheres and hyphospheres, given the predominance of associations with mycorrhizal fungi. Distinct microbial communities have been identified in the mycorrhizosphere under different tree species; these are influenced both by the tree species and by the mycorrhizal fungi with which the tree associates. Heightened attention during sampling to ensure comparison of ‘like with like’ could improve our ability to distinguish influence of tree species in decomposing litter, forest floors and soil. A significant remaining challenge is characterizing exudates from different tree-mycorrhizal fungi associations and understanding interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and microbial communities in the hyphosphere. A complete tapestry of the linkages between tree species and soil microbial communities requires that we also weave in the effects of soil fauna.},

Ericoid, and some ectomycorrhizal fungi have the potential to be directly involved in attack both on structural polymers, which may render nutrients inaccessible, and in mobilization of N and P from the organic polymers in which they are sequestered. The advantages to the plant of achieving intervention in the microbial mobilization–immobilization cycles are stressed. While the new approaches may initially lack the precision achieved in studies of readily characterized ionic forms of N and P, they do provide insights of greater ecological relevance. The results support the hypothesis that selection has favoured ericoid and ectomycorrhizal systems with well developed saprotrophic capabilities in those ecosystems characterized by retention of N and P as organic complexes in the soil. The need for further investigation of the abilities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to intervene in nutrient mobilization processes is stressed.},

  abstract = {Tree species can influence rates of soil N transformations, but the question remains whether differences in N cycling rates are mirrored by the abundance of relevant functional genes. We studied whether the influence of tree species on soil N transformation processes and abundance of functional genes exist across two sites in British Columbia with different N availability. We used the 15N pool-dilution method to estimate gross rates of ammonification and nitrification in forest floors of four conifers in a common garden experiment. The abundances of bacteria, fungi, nitrification (AOA amoA, AOB amoA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK) genes were determined by qPCR. Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) had the highest rates of gross ammonification and NH4+ consumption, followed by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); all species showed net nitrate immobilization. Western red cedar forest floors had the greatest abundance of bacterial 16S genes and ammonia-oxidizing archaea amoA genes. This suggests that tree species foster different abundances of ammonification and denitrification functional groups. Differences in N transformation rates between the sites were related to site N status, as reflected in C:N ratios of the forest floor and microbial biomass, and were more closely tied to rates of N consumption rather than gross mineralization. Rates of most N transformation processes were related to microbial C:N ratio, indicating that the N status of microbes rather than their biomass or activity level determined the rates of N cycling. Ammonification rates were associated with forest floor and microbial biomass C:N ratio as well as bacterial and fungal abundances. Nitrification rates and denitrification gene abundance were associated with microbial biomass C:N ratios and AOA amoA gene abundance. The forest floor's genetic potential for denitrification was positively correlated with its nitrification potential as indicated by ammonia-oxidizer abundance. We conclude that tree species influenced forest floor N cycling and soil microbial gene abundances, and that functional genetics can be useful for exploring mechanistic links between tree species and nitrogen cycling processes.},

  abstract = {Lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) are historically known for their role as microbial-derived signaling molecules that shape plant symbiosis with beneficial rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi. Recent studies showing that LCOs are widespread across the fungal kingdom have raised questions about the ecological function of these compounds in organisms that do not form symbiotic relationships with plants. To elucidate the ecological function of these compounds, we investigate the metabolomic response of the ubiquitous human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus to LCOs. Our metabolomics data revealed that exogenous application of various types of LCOs to A. fumigatus resulted in significant shifts in the fungal metabolic profile, with marked changes in the production of specialized metabolites known to mediate ecological interactions. Using network analyses, we identify specific types of LCOs with the most significant effect on the abundance of known metabolites. Extracts of several LCO-induced metabolic profiles significantly impact the growth rates of diverse bacterial species. These findings suggest that LCOs may play an important role in the competitive dynamics of non-plant-symbiotic fungi and bacteria. This study identifies specific metabolomic profiles induced by these ubiquitously produced chemicals and creates a foundation for future studies into the potential roles of LCOs as modulators of interkingdom competition. IMPORTANCE The activation of silent biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) for the identification and characterization of novel fungal secondary metabolites is a perpetual motion in natural product discoveries. Here, we demonstrated that one of the best-studied symbiosis signaling compounds, lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), play a role in activating some of these BGCs, resulting in the production of known, putative, and unknown metabolites with biological activities. This collection of metabolites induced by LCOs differentially modulate bacterial growth, while the LCO standards do not convey the same effect. These findings create a paradigm shift showing that LCOs have a more prominent role outside of host recognition of symbiotic microbes. Importantly, our work demonstrates that fungi use LCOs to produce a variety of metabolites with biological activity, which can be a potential source of bio-stimulants, pesticides, or pharmaceuticals.},

The ultrastructure of the septal pore (dolipore with imperforate caps) was typical for sebacinoids. In one case, intracellular colonization was seen.

However, understanding and predicting the behavior and function of these microorganisms remains a grand challenge for soil ecology due in part to the microscale complexity of soils. It is becoming increasingly clear that understanding the microbial perspective is vital to accurately predicting global processes. Here, we discuss the microbial perspective including the microbial habitat as it relates to measurement and modeling of ecosystem processes. We argue that clearly defining and quantifying the size, distribution and sphere of influence of microhabitats is crucial to managing microbial activity at the ecosystem scale. This can be achieved using controlled and hierarchical sampling designs. Model microbial systems can provide key data needed to integrate microhabitats into ecosystem models, while adapting soil sampling schemes and statistical methods can allow us to collect microbially-focused data. Quantifying soil processes, like biogeochemical cycles, from a microbial perspective will allow us to more accurately predict soil functions and address long-standing unknowns in soil ecology.},

  abstract = {The climatic response of trees that occupy closed canopy forests in the eastern United States (US) is important to understanding the possible trajectory these forests may take in response to a warming climate. Our study examined tree rings of 664 trees from five oak species (white (Quercus alba L.), black (Quercus velutina Lam.), chestnut (Quercus prinus L.), northern red (Quercus rubra L.). scarlet (Quercus coccinea Münchh.)) from 17 stands in eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, and northern Georgia to determine their climatic response. We dated the samples using skeleton plots, measured the cores, and compared the site- and regional-level tree-ring chronologies of each separate species with divisional climate data. The oldest trees in each chronology dated back to 203 years for black oak, 299 years for chestnut oak, 171 years for northern red oak, 135 years for scarlet oak, and 291 years for white oak. We successfully developed climate models via multiple regression analyses with statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.05) variables representing the Palmer Drought Severity Index and average monthly temperature for most of the site-species chronologies (average R2 = 0.15). All regional climate response models included the Palmer Drought Severity Index from either June or July as the most significant variable in the climate response, suggesting that growing-season drought is the most important factor limiting oak growth in the southeastern US. An increase in temperature and reduction in moisture is likely to reduce their competitiveness in their current locations and force these species to migrate to cooler climates, thereby greatly changing ecosystem health and stability in the southern Appalachians.

The sources from which Burkholderia species have been isolated are manifold, but the accumulated evidence suggests that soil, where Burkholderia can be associated with a wide range of plants and fungi, is its natural habitat. The genus comprises two class-3 pathogens, Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia pseudomallei, but a growing number of Burkholderia species has been reported as opportunistic pathogens in humans. Burkholderia bacteria appear to have a predilection for the respiratory tract as life-threatening lung infections occur in individuals with cystic fibrosis or chronic granulomatous disease, and in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Burkholderia bacteria have rightfully been referred to as both friend and foe to humans. While the first Burkholderia species were primarily known as plant, human, and animal pathogens, subsequent studies revealed their biotechnological potential for plant growth promotion, biocontrol of various plant pests, and bioremediation. Because of this wide interest, an unusual number of whole-genome sequences has become available, yet generally failed to reveal the difference between good or bad, or alternatively, biotechnologically safe or unsafe, species or strains.

Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5–20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Disentangling the relative response sensitivity of soil autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) to nitrogen (N) enrichment is pivotal for evaluating soil carbon (C) storage and stability in the scenario of intensified N deposition. However, the mechanisms underlying differential sensitivities of Ra and Rh and relative contribution of Rh to soil respiration (Rs) with increasing N deposition remain elusive. A manipulative field experiment with multi-level N addition rates was conducted over 3 years (2015–2017) in an alpine meadow to explore the relative impact of N enrichment on Ra and Rh and the response of Rh/Rs ratio to the gradient of N addition. Soil respiration components had different sensitivities to N enrichment, with Ra decreasing more than Rh, leading to a higher Rh/Rs ratio as a function of increasing N addition rates. Ra and Rh decreased nonlinearly as N addition rates increased, with a critical load of 8 g N m−2 year−1 above which N enrichment significantly inhibited them. Ra and Rh were controlled by different abiotic and biotic factors, and the regulation of controlling factors on soil respiration components varied over time. N-induced reduction in the relative abundance of forb significantly affected Ra, and this effect was mainly evident in the second and third years. Nitrogen enrichment significantly changed Rh in the third year, and the decreased Rh under high doses of N addition could be attributed to the changes in microbial biomass C, soil substrate quality and microbial composition. Our study highlights the leading role of Ra in regulating Rs responses to N enrichment and the enhancement of Rh/Rs ratio with increasing N addition. We also emphasize that N-induced shifts in plant community composition play a vital role in regulating Ra instead of Rh. The changing drivers of Ra and Rh with time suggests that long-term experiments with multiple levels of N addition are further needed to test the nonlinear responses and underlying mechanisms of soil respiration components in face to aggravating N deposition.

  abstract = {Disruption of healthy microbial communities has been linked to numerous diseases, yet microbial interactions are little understood. This is due in part to the large number of bacteria, and the much larger number of interactions (easily in the millions), making experimental investigation very difficult at best and necessitating the nascent field of computational exploration through microbial correlation networks. We benchmark the performance of eight correlation techniques on simulated and real data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies: fractional sampling of ribosomal RNA sequences, uneven sampling depths, rare microbes and a high proportion of zero counts. Also tested is the ability to distinguish signals from noise, and detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships. Finally, we provide specific recommendations for correlation technique usage. Although some methods perform better than others, there is still considerable need for improvement in current techniques.},

  abstract = {1 Relationships between mycorrhizal plants and soil nitrogen (N) have led to the speculation that the chemistry of plant litter and the saprotrophy of mycorrhizal symbionts can function together to closely couple the N cycle between plants and soils. We hypothesized that a tannin-rich, ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) plant promotes the retention of protein–tannin N in soil, and that this N source is accessible to saprotrophic ERM symbionts and their hosts, but remains less available to co-occurring ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbionts and their hosts. 2 We tested this feedback hypothesis in a southern Appalachian forest community composed of two microsites: a hardwood microsite with ECM and AM trees in the overstorey and understorey, and an AM herb layer; and a rhododendron microsite where the understorey and herb layer are replaced by ERM rhododendron. We synthesized 15N-enriched protein–tannin complexes from leaf litter extracts representing each forest microsite and examined the fate of 15N in soil volumes 3 months and 1 year after the complexes were placed in the field. 3 Protein–tannin complexes derived from the rhododendron microsite led to a higher retention of 15N in soil organic matter and a lower recovery in dissolved N pools than those from the hardwood microsite, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron tannins create stable complexes that increase organic N retention in soils. 4 Rhododendron complexes led to greater 15N-enrichment in ERM roots than in AM and ECM roots, supporting the hypothesis that rhododendron can better access the N complexed by its own litter tannins than can co-occurring forest trees and plants. Our results suggest that both fungal saprotrophy and a high specific root length contribute to the ability of ERM roots to acquire N from complex organic sources. 5 Synthesis. This study provides evidence of an intricate N feedback where plant litter chemistry influences the cycle of N to maximize N acquisition by the host's mycorrhizal roots, while hindering N acquisition by mycorrhizal roots of co-occurring plants. Feedback processes such as these have the potential to drive patterns in nitrogen cycling and productivity in many terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Soil respiration (Rs) plays a crucial role in regulating carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems and the at­ mospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. However, the impact of nitrogen (N) addition on Rs and its temperature sensitivity (Q10) is poorly understood. Here, we used 1413 paired observations from 261 studies to explore how N addition affects Rs and its Q10 across terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale. Nitrogen addition increased autotrophic respiration in croplands, deserts and shrublands, but decreased it in grasslands, forests (including coniferous and deciduous forests) and wetlands. In contrast, N addition increased heterotrophic respiration in grasslands, wetlands and deserts, but decreased its Q10 across different ecosystem types other than deserts. Nitrogen addition decreased (p {$<$} 0.05) the overall Rs and its Q10 by 19.5 and 32.1\%, respectively. The decrease in Rs in response to N addition might be attributed to a reduction in heterotrophic respiration. Moreover, the Rs and its Q10 decreased while soil organic C content increased with the increasing rate of N addition up to 100–150 kg ha− 1 yr− 1. The results suggest that 100–150 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1 was the optimum N addition rate to maintain the soil as a C sink. In addition, soil pH, C:N ratio and respiratory quotient were significant predictors of soil respiration and its Q10. Our study highlights that the N addition rate-dependent effects on Rs and its Q10, and soil organic C should be incorporated into global C models to improve the assessment of N addition effects on the global C cycle.},

  abstract = {The activity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) leads to the loss of nitrogen from soil, pollution of water sources and elevated emissions of greenhouse gas. To date, eight AOA genomes are available in the public databases, seven are from the group I.1a of the Thaumarchaeota and only one is from the group I.1b, isolated from hot springs. Many soils are dominated by AOA from the group I.1b, but the genomes of soil representatives of this group have not been sequenced and functionally characterized. The lack of knowledge of metabolic pathways of soil AOA presents a critical gap in understanding their role in biogeochemical cycles. Here, we describe the first complete genome of soil archaeon Candidatus Nitrososphaera evergladensis, which has been reconstructed from metagenomic sequencing of a highly enriched culture obtained from an agricultural soil. The AOA enrichment was sequenced with the high throughput next generation sequencing platforms from Pacific Biosciences and Ion Torrent. The de novo assembly of sequences resulted in one 2.95 Mb contig. Annotation of the reconstructed genome revealed many similarities of the basic metabolism with the rest of sequenced AOA. Ca. N. evergladensis belongs to the group I.1b and shares only 40\% of whole-genome homology with the closest sequenced relative Ca. N. gargensis. Detailed analysis of the genome revealed coding sequences that were completely absent from the group I.1a. These unique sequences code for proteins involved in control of DNA integrity, transporters, two-component systems and versatile CRISPR defense system. Notably, genomes from the group I.1b have more gene duplications compared to the genomes from the group I.1a. We suggest that the presence of these unique genes and gene duplications may be associated with the environmental versatility of this group.},
